	The files in this directory are simple examples and test programs
that can be assembled, downloaded and run on the Handy development system.

	Here is a list of the files in this directory and their contents:


README		- this file
Songs		- a directory containing music files for testhmusic.src
TestAll		- a script file that when executed builds all the programs

cartdefs.i	- a sample include file showing how to set up the definitions
		  needed by the cartridge filing system

divide.src	- an example written for the Lynx developers conference,
		  demonstrates the divide function of the math hardware
mandel.src	- a Mandelbrot/Julian set explorer, demonstrates the math
		  hardware
mult32.src	- an example written for the Lynx developers conference,
		  shows how to perform multiply by parts
multiply.src	- written for the Lynx developers conference, demonstrates 
		  the multiply function of the math hardware
spritedemo.src	- written for the Lynx developers conference, demonstrates
		  the capabilities of the "sprites"
testaudio.src	- demonstrates some simple sound effects on the Lynx
testcart.hsf	- HandyRom source file to put together cartridge demo example
		  testcart.src must be assembled first
testcart.src	- demonstrates the cartridge file system
testcontrols.src - test program that reads joystick/buttons
testhmusic.src	- demonstrates the hmusic music system
testhprint.src	- demonstrates HPRINT text output macros
testredeye.src	- demonstrates use of redeye (comlynx) communication code
testsprite.src	- does some simple things with sprites on the screen


	Most of the first programs developed started with testsprite.src
as the base, and then built the code up from there.


			Have fun,
