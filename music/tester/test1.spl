;FB $2   	;	About the same as FB $1 which is to say a normal square wave
;LTR 12  	;good for clarinets, wooden marimbas, electric piano, etc.

;FB $3		;	this is a razzy thing in between a narrow pulse  
;LTR 7		;	and a sawtooth wave

;FB $4		;	sounds a lot like the default square wave, but just a few 
;LTR 19		;	cents flat-makes for a nice rich chorus with default

;FB $5		;	SOUNDS LIKE ANOTHER NARROW 20%PULSE OR SAWTOOTHISH SOUND
;LTR 22		;	it is so sharp that it's almost a quarter tone off 7hz chorus

;FB $6		;	ALMOST IDENTICAL TO FB $5
;LTR 22		;

;FB $7		;	sounds identical to default but note the LTR on it...
;LTR 12

;FB $8		;	IDENTICAL TO DEFAULT BUT 2 OCTAVES FLAT
;LTR 24

;FB $9		;	MAKES FOR A NICE CHORUS WITH DEFAULT-narrow pulse
;LTR 35		;	that is just a bit sharp-1.4hz chorus


;FB $A		;	ANOTHER NARROW PULSE 10% TO 20%-A BIT FLAT-BEATS AT 3hz
;LTR 19

;FB $B		; finally a unique timbre: its got a loud high harmonic-still
;LTR 34		; sits quite sharp-be good for glockenspiel or bells/beats at 10hz

;FB $C		; almost an oboe in quality, this one sits a few cycles sharp
;LTR 35		; and beats at a good 2hz

;FB $D		;Whichever harmonic sits on the third about three octaves sharp
;LTR 31		;is the one what be loud here-still quite sharp-nice chorus with default

;FB $E		;Noticibly sharp and obnoxious, this is another narrow pulse thing
;LTR 34

;FB $f		;Quite sharp but not obnoxious, another pulse-but thicker
;LTR 16


;=============bank two=================================================================


;FB $10		;IDENTICAL TO DEFAULT BUT A DOZEN OR SO CENTS SHARP
;LTR 28


;FB $11		;PRoduces an annoying high frequency whine and is real sharp and
;LTR 53		;narrow in character.

;FB $12		; Couldn't do a thing for this baby-hi pitch non note activity
;LTR 48		; it's also a quarter step sharp at this setting-real narrow pulse

;FB $13		; This one's pretty sharp with a real loud harmonic 2 octaves 
;LTR 46		; up at the fifth-oh, yeah-it's noticibly sharp-nice combination 
		; sound, though.

;FB $14		; THIS IS THE EVIL TWIN OF FB $12
;LTR 47		; QUARTER TONE FLAT

;FB $15		; a real loud tone-has that high (majorthird) harmonic and
;LTR 47		;is flat enough to make a rich chorus sound

;FB $16		;More saw than square, this one's slightly flat
;LTR 31

;FB $17		; as unusable as they come - just can't get this one in tune
;LTR 46

;FB $18		; ANOTHER THIN PULSE WAVE- QUITE SHARP-THERE IS A HIGH FREQ 
;LTR 41		; WHINE BETWEEN NOTES, TOO 

;FB $19		; A WINNER! NO DETUNING, AND A NICE HIGH LOUD HARMONIC-PROBABLY
;LTR 24		; GOOD FOR PERCUSSIVE LEAD AND CHORDAL LINES

;FB $1A		; sounds a bit flat-this one is "ring" like (as in bells)
;LTR 47		; with real digital clarity hahaha

;FB $1B		; yet another quarter tone off tone-this one's quite nasal
;LTR 48		; but has a bit of the old sawtooth in it, yet...GOT THAT WHINE, TOO.

;FB $1C		; THIS ONE sounds quite sharp alone-features nice high harmonics
;LTR 46		; and choruses nicely with the default

;	NOTE-AT THIS POINT, LTR's HAD GOTTEN SO EXTREME THAT I FELT IT WAS TIME
;	TO ALTER THE TEST SEQUENCE-NOTE THAT FROM HERE FORWARD ALL VALUES HAVE
;	AN IMBEDDED OFFSET OF TWO OCTAVES (AUTOMATIC BASS GENERATION IN OTHER WORDS)

;FB $1D		; nice and hornlike, but far too flat to be useful without VFM's
;LTR 23		


;FB $1E		;QUARTER TONE OFF, HI PITCH WHINE, english horn-like tambour
;LTR 23

;FB $1F		; nice sorta rich sawtooth with very slight dark flat intonation
;LTR -5		; which makes for a nice chorus with default


;============================bank three==========================================


;FB $20		; Just a bit flatter than above, this one sounds almost identical
;LTR 7		; to the default

;FB $21		; very nasal and buzzer like, this one is fairly flat and causes
;LTR 36		; a hi pitch whine in between notes

;FB $22		; SORT OF A DRY SAWTOOTH SOUND-FAIRLY SHARP WITH FAST CHORUS
;LTR 10

;FB $23		; HI WHINE, A BIT FLAT AND SLIGHTLY THINNER SOUNDING THAN
;LTR 36		; THE DEFAULT

;FB $24		;REAL COOL with the default-slightly flat-just enough to 
;LTR 2		; barely chorus with the default-soft, muffled, rich tone.


;FB $25		; THIS one has a bright nasal tone-very digital/piezo like
;LTR 22		; it is sharp enough to phase about 1hz 

;FB $26		; THIS ONE'S A BIT FLAT WITH HI WHINE STUFF TWIXT NOTES
;LTR 36		; SOUNDS LIKE A STEPPED ON THIN PULSE

;FB $27		; USEABLE 20% OR SO PULSE-IT IS A BIT SHARP AND 
;LTR 11		; PHASES AT ABOUT 2hz

;FB $28		; Fast (4hz) chorus and a pulse/saw sound characterize this one
;LTR 10 	

;FB $29		; This one's a real bug killer-high ringing harmonic and it's
;LTR 29		;noticeably sharp (2 or 3hz phase)ALSO A REAL HIGH WHINE

;FB $2A		; Nice in tune sawtooth like sound-muted brass sounds
;LTR 0

;FB $2B		;NICE SAWTOOTH-but it's sharp and produces those annoying
;LTR 17		; HIGHHH PITTCHHED WHINEE SOUNDGRRR!

;FB $2C		; It's  bit flat (2hz), hi pitch whine twixt notes-some high 
;LTR 36 	; harmonic content giving it a thin but present sound

;FB $2D		; quite flat quite nasal sounding quite annoying hipitch whine
;LTR 36
 
;FB $2E		; kinda sharp, hornlike, bright sounding-trumpet type
;LTR 11


;======================bank four===================================================

;FB $30		; SOUNDS VERY THIN TO ME, AND VERY FLAT. CHORUS AT 6hz
;LTR 36

;FB $31		; SHARP ENOUGH TO CHORUS WELL (2hz) has nice prominent high harmonic
;LTR 16

;FB $32		;it's a bit sharp for solo work- prominent high harmonic as in $31
;LTR 29		; hi pitch artifacting tone(y'know, I betcha it has sumpin to do wit dem rests what we got)

;FB $33		;this one sounded more in tune an octave south at LTR 24...sawtooth
;LTR 36		; that's sawtooth/real flat/ artifacting tone imbed. hahaha

;FB $34		; Sharp enuff to hurt-but still useable as a solo voice
;LTR 22		; choruses at 2-3hz

;FB $35		; Real digital sound/sorta beepy-like/beats at 1hz, maybe....
;LTR 7


;FB $36		; Really flat/ artifacting tone/ like a 10% pulse
;LTR 36

;FB $37		; MEDIUM CHORUS real sticky sounding pulse artifacting etc.

;LTR 36

;FB $3A		; Thin reedy sound/ a bit sharp REAL high artifact
;LTR 17

;FB 3B		; SOUNDS LIKE A MUTED SAWTOOTH 1hz chorus-good one
;LTR -17

;FB 3C		;MUCH LIKE FB 3B- A BIT FULLER MORE MUTED
;LTR -17

;FB $3D		;REALLY THIN/ARTIFACTING/FLAT ENUFF FOR 2hz chorus

;FB $42		;IDENTICAL TO DEFAULT

;FB $43		;A bit flat/sounds like a sawtooth/triangle combo
;LTR -17

;FB $44		;SOUNDS LIKE A BIT FLAT VERSION OF THE DEFAULT
;LTR -5

;FB $45		;QUITE SHARP 3hz chorus mid pulse/sawtooth sound
;LTR -2

;LTR -12

;FB $48		; SOUNDS LIKE THE DEFAULT TO ME
;LTR 0

;FB $59		; Makes my head hurt-high harmonic and muted low harmonix
;LTR 0		; real digital sounds

;FB $CC		;NICE UNIQUE TAMBOUR BUT QUARTER STEPOFF AND ARTIFACTING

;FB $DE		;Y'KNOW, SOMETIMES YOU JUST CAN'T STOP YOURSELF FROM TAKING THOSE
