Dear RJ:

	This then would be yet another of my rambling missives to yerself.

H-MUZAK...JUST WHEN YOU THOUGHT IT WAS SAFE TO RELEASE A DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM:

The envelope generator still doesn't werk as advertised...seems to calculate 
strange stuff with different agd/asd values-for what it's worth, the only difference 
a too short agd should make is a truncation of the existing structure-not interact
with the structure...percussive voices continue to be a problem-if i set up
an attack of say, 2 going to an initial peak of 90 and decaying at a rate of 3
to a sustain of 5 (followed by a releaseof 15 after the agd/asd has played
 out) i should hear something along the lines of a plucked guitar string...

NIGHTMARE ON HSFX STREET-part XIII: "Where's The Money For Drugs?"

Plesas to grunterstand thet we in 0ddio wish not to stir trubble or deviate
other of programmer persons from their rather scary and integral dooties, but we 
really should have functional cut n' paste on hsfx.  in addition, we need a
werking buffer window, and a gadget to allow bi/tri/quad-phonic audition 
of hsfx zoundz would give a lotta bang fer thee buckx...In udder matterz-
when hsfx are created and saved, the default format should be a .src file.
...Larry abel suggested considering the hsfxfiles more like IFF files-rather than
disposing of the currently unused header, implementing tools into it that
would handle different applications...I know, I know, I know-an impossible
task with no payoff, but wait...properly implemented would speed up several
applications...

...stay tuned-same bat time, same bat channel...
