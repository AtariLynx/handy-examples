Ricoh patch problem & digitized sound

The software workaround which was distributed recently to handle a run of
buggy Suzy chips has a bug of its own which can show up in two cases.  Games
which try to access the joystick and switches or the ROM cart in an interrupt
routine will have problems if the ricoh patch is included.  The problem shows
up as garbled sounds in the digitized sound driver.

The recommended solution for now is to leave out the ricoh patch if you are
using the digitized sound driver (you can do this by defining the assembly
switch NO_RICOH_PATCH).  We will send a new version of the driver that has a
workaround in the next release, allowing the digitized sound driver and the
ricoh patch to work together.

Also, anyone writing an interrupt routine that accesses the ROM cart or the
joystick needs to be aware of the need for a workaround.  You can check with
me for details if you are doing something like this.
