# Examples from Handy Development System

Included are the original examples of the Handy Development System revision 1.6.

It includes the `6502:examples` folder on the branch `original`.
The `main` branch has a reworked structure and has assembled and compiled binaries, roms and emulator files.

You can attach the contents of a cloned main branch to an WinUAE or FS-UAE emulator with the Handy development kit installed. All examples are recreatable following the instructions in the other `README.md` files
